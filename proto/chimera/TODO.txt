One JSON file to describe all parameters of the pipeline (for now)

sub-tools:

	1. generate-fingerprint


	2. extract-droplet-features

       inputs:
         - fingerprint
         - (optional) gene groups

	   - always use family-size-truncated (FST) count matrix 

	   - calculate droplet efficiencies
	     Q: total UMIs? geometric mean? saturation curve? for now, let's use total UMIs

	   - calculate log mean gene expression (geometric mean)

	   - GP NB fit w/ linear droplet efficiency over log mean gene expression
	     (similar to scTransform)

	   - VST the FST count matrix wrt. to GP fit _prior_
	   
	   - select HVG from each gene group based on residual variance

	   - perform PCA on VST count matrix

	   outputs:
	     - droplet pca features
	     - droplet size features


	3. model-fingerprint

	   inputs:
	     - droplet pca and size features

       - pre-train gene expression prior over droplet pca and size features
         (NB on FST count matrix)
         
         * a regularization to encourage smaller over-dispersion of NB

       - train droplet-time-machine

       - save model

	4. back-to-droplets

	   - inputs:
	     - fingerprint
	     - trained dtm model
	     - gene indices

	   - perform posterior sampling

action items:

  - get rid of zero inflation everywhere and produce a working version without zero 
    inflation

  - make a notebook for extract-droplet-features

  - make a notebook for droplet-time-machine
